AskoziaPBX
==========

Originally a proof-of-concept research project started by myself in 2007.
Development ceased in this tree in mid-July, 2011.
This is a full backup of that Subversion repository for historical purposes.
If you contributed code to AskoziaPBX during this period, please open an issue so the commit name and e-mail address can be updated to reference your current GitHub account.

Askozia is now a full-grown company with multiple (awesome) products!
